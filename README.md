# classcount
Features:

    Class Count Display: Automatically detects and displays how many of each class are present in your group or raid. This includes all classes such as Warriors, Mages, Priests, etc.
    Total Player Count: In addition to class breakdown, the addon shows the total number of players currently in the group or raid.
    Dynamic Updates: The data refreshes dynamically as players join or leave the group or raid, ensuring that you always have up-to-date information.

How It Affects User Experience:

    Quick Class Overview: Instead of manually inspecting the raid or group, this addon provides a consolidated view of your party composition, allowing for faster decision-making, especially in raid environments where class balance is critical.
    Raid Preparation: Helps raid leaders ensure proper class representation, such as having enough healers, tanks, or specific classes needed for encounters, without the hassle of manually counting.
    Group Management Efficiency: For smaller groups like dungeon or battleground teams, knowing the class breakdown instantly helps optimize strategies, making party management much more streamlined.
